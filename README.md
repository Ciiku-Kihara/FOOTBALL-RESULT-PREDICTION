# FOOTBALL-RESULT-PREDICTION
The aim of this project was to build models to predict whether a team would win or lose given a number of features such as the home team's rank.

## Description
This repository contains a Jupiter notebook that I used to build models to determine whether the home team would win lose or draw. This dataset was obtained 
from FIFA. The features I was working with were: the away team's FIFA ranking, the away team's FIFA ranking, and the tournament type.
I was expected to implement the solution by building polynomial models and a logistic model. I also compared the accuracy of the model created using logistic regression
and models created with SVM and Random Forest. 
This was my first attempt at tackling a project using machine learning
